# Docker Statistics Application

> This project is the practical element of a Cloud Infrastructure module in college. It aims to use the concepts of [Dockprom][dockprom-url] and apply them to Docker swarm. It will mostly be used by another repository of mine [Docker-Swarm-with-Ansible][swarm-url] which will install this application remotely on the swarm hosts.
